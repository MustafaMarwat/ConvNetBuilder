## Introduction

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized image processing and recognition tasks. However, understanding how they work internally can be just as crucial as using pre-built libraries. This repository provides detailed code for creating CNNs from scratch, covering essential components like convolution layers, pooling layers, forward passes, and backward passes.

## Features

- **Fundamental Learning**: Dive deep into the basics of CNNs and develop a solid understanding of the architecture.
- **Step-by-Step Explanations**: Every code block is explained to help learners grasp the underlying concepts.
- **Convolution Layers**: Create convolution layers that extract features from input images.
- **Pooling Layers**: Implement max-pooling and average-pooling layers to downsize feature maps.
- **Forward and Backward Passes**: Build both forward and backward passes for training your CNN.
- **Great for Beginners and Experts**: Whether you're new to CNNs or want to customize your networks, this project caters to all levels.

## Contents

1. **Convolution Layer**: We'll explore the essentials of convolution layers and create them from scratch.
2. **Pooling Layer**: Dive into max-pooling and average-pooling layers and learn how they reduce input size.
3. **Forward Pass**: Implement the forward pass to compute CNN output.
4. **Backward Pass**: Develop the backward pass to calculate gradients and fine-tune your network.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (3.5+)
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the notebook)
  
## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ConvNetBuilder.git
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook CNN_from_Scratch.ipynb to start exploring and running the code.

3. Follow along with the step-by-step instructions to build your CNN from scratch and understand how it works.
4.
